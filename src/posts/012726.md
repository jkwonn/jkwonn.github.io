my friend tried getting me into skating. he showed me a couple videos, mainly of flashy street skating. one could say that i was persuaded into it.

the search for skates themselves took a tad bit longer. in many aspects of my life, past a certain point of performance, i will always go for my preferred form over a slight benefit in function. 

the only pair of frames i could find that i wanted were 500 dollars.

the dilemma continues.
