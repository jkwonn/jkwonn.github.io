i think it'd be pretty cool to make a log for every day of the year from now on 

i have some other goals besides that for this year
- im gonna bench 225 by the end of the year my current 1 rep max is 195 200 ish but i havent been at that strength since november ish. i went to the gym today and i got 2 reps of 165, i could probably do 1 of 185 right now.
- i would like to be able to run a half marathon before the year ends. but theres always ice outside and i dont like running indoors which sucks.
- lets hit 100k on socials. just for the fun and games. 
- hopefully i will write a book. or at least a very large portion of it.

i recently found out that theres a good chance i have a job this summer so thats good news for me! and also it is lowkey my dream summer opportunity ,,,

today was a boring day, i got the verbal offer for the job yesterday afternoon. todays highlights were a not amazing gym session which was supposed to be legs but turned into upper because the one friend who wanted to hit legs came an hour late.
