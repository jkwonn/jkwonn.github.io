sometimes when i write these little snippets i feel like im horsemeat in his car.

i went roller skating with friends after classes (friday night). it was really really really cold outside like if i went to sleep i probably would have died cold. i learned a new way to shemagh wrap my whole head so my ears don't freeze off. my carhartt jacket hood isn't really the right shape so i don't like to put it on.

theres a couple of friends that i've begun to see a lot these days, just a side effect of this new bubble of friends i've found. it's really different since my roommate left this semester. i didn't think much would change but surprisingly the whole dynamic has shifted.

one of them enjoys cherries. maraschino cherries. cherry flavored lollipops. 

we walked the cherry enjoyer back and by the time i got home it was 4 am. i sat upon a vent for a couple minutes on the way back so my toes wouldn't freeze.

there's this movie called 100 meters, it's about running (not really its more about life). it reminded me of oysters with lemon. or maybe marty supreme. probably both.
