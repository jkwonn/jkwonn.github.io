i met someone new today (jm)
when he came up to me he said hi i love your videos

i wonder what the aggregate impression that people have of me are

what has changed in the way that people approach me and the way i approach people based off of the fact that i've posted videos of myself before?

do i have to fit into the character i portray?

what if i don't fit into the character i write

i would like to make more content and branch out, but that would simply mean that the surface area of people that i reach would grow even further. i'm comfortable at a stage of tiny popularity/recognition that i have. but to grow more means more results and more that i achieve.

and the competitive spirit in me doesn't care much for my modesty either

i want to be bigger and better and doing more

haha i wonder how these writing blurbs change perception too
