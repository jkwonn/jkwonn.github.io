i filmed some bits with my friend who helped me with a short film i wanted to make last year. unfortunately that film has not seen the light of day yet. it's a lot harder to translate your emotions into concrete scenes, than one might think.

also flog2 is actually the worst format to grade ever.

i imagine that all of us are born in log. with low contrast, with technical ceilings, with over or under exposure or maybe perfect exposure.

and as we live our lives, we're slowly seasoned into existence. of course, you could be touched in a way you might not want. a hue shift, a white balance. a result unpleasant to your overall image.

and maybe your image is tweaked too much, to the point where your data corrupts. but as long as you reset, you'll be back to the same base. with that being stated, i believe that nurture takes some precedence over nature. some fundamental traits can't be changed through grading (for example, the image itself, the framing and content), but with clever technical knowledge, an advanced colorist will be able to harness most shots just by consistently working with them.

i wonder what i look like graded. i think i was raised well. rec709 lut. layers and adjustments. maybe a couple of accidental splashes and tweaks here and there.
