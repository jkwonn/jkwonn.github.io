my friend (m) ate a giant p terrys sandwich for lunch 1700 calories of bulk 

after my hair gets wet it dries to the side. if i didnt make it go to the right as well, it would all go to the left. 

i ate dinner (mapo tofu) that my friends cooked and met a new person today, a very nice experience. i need to do it more.

the rainbow sherbet wasnt sour and this upset me

and then played smash bros (dk and mc) and drank banana milk after
somehow greninja gets me my best results so far
