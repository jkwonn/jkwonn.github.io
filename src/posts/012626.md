my friend (j) who is one year under me had a pretty long conversation with me the other week which first prompted my thinking upon this topic. it started pretty normally and progressed around the topic of cs majors being cooked.

it started from his seeking advice upon my route for getting to intern and work in tech, then developed through his feelings on the application process. strangely enough, i think i've had a similar conversation to most people with careers in this area this year.
