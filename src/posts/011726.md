got lunch with a good friend that i havent seen in a while. decent katsu curry and mediocre california rolls. sushi in the midwest !

peach oolong tea at vienna

frosted lemondae at chickfila

i watched josee (the korean live action version of josee the tiger and the fish) with my friend and my new roommate

quite the experience and a slightly confusing movie, probably going to spin back and watch more variations/this specific film again. i actually haven't watched any of the other versions of josee the tiger and the fish before, only seen snippets of it through assorted other forms of media.

am i a qualified person to give career advice to my friends ?
